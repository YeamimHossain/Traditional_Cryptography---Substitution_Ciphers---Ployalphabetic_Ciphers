# Traditional Cryptography – Substitution & Polyalphabetic Ciphers

This repository contains implementations and explanations of **traditional (classical) cryptographic techniques**, focusing on **substitution ciphers** and **polyalphabetic ciphers**. The project is designed for **educational and academic purposes**, helping learners understand the foundations of classical encryption.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔐 Substitution Ciphers
Techniques where each character in the plaintext is replaced by another character according to a fixed rule.


### 🔐 Polyalphabetic Ciphers
Polyalphabetic ciphers use **multiple substitution alphabets**, making them more secure than simple substitution techniques.

- **AutoKey Cipher** – A polyalphabetic substitution method that extends a key using the message itself.
- **Playfair Cipher** – A digraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.
- **Vigenère Cipher** – A well-known polyalphabetic cipher using a repeating key.


Each notebook provides:
- cipher explanation and history
- encryption algorithm
- decryption process
- working examples
